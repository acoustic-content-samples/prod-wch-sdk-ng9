## redux-store package

Implementation of a [Redux](https://redux.js.org/api/store) store with support for adding feature modules, dynamically.

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [createIdentifier(idOrModuleId, aValue)](./redux-store.createidentifier.md) | Scopes the given ID with a feature prefix to make it unique |
|  [createReduxFeatureModule(idOrModuleId, reducer, epic, dependencies)](./redux-store.createreduxfeaturemodule.md) | Convenience method to create a feature module |
|  [createReduxMetaModule(dependencies)](./redux-store.createreduxmetamodule.md) | Convenience method to create a meta module, i.e. a module that bundles other modules |
|  [createReduxRootStore(aDependencies, aPreLoadedState)](./redux-store.createreduxrootstore.md) | Constructs a new store that can handle feature modules. |
|  [featureModuleId(id)](./redux-store.featuremoduleid.md) | Constructs a feature module ID that carries type information |
|  [ofInitFeature(idOrModuleId)](./redux-store.ofinitfeature.md) | Returns an operator function that filters the initialization actions for a particular feature. This is typically used in feature epics. Since we know that an initialization can occur at most once, the operator also terminates automatically after the first emission. |
|  [rxSelectFeature(idOrModuleId)](./redux-store.rxselectfeature.md) | Returns a selector that selects the given feature from the store and returns an observable to that feature state. |
|  [rxStore(aStore)](./redux-store.rxstore.md) | Exposes the store as an [Observable](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/class/Observable)<!-- -->. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [PayloadAction](./redux-store.payloadaction.md) | Base class for actions that carry a payload. Use the [selectPayload](./redux-store.selectpayload.md) method to extract the payload. |
|  [ReduxFeatureModule](./redux-store.reduxfeaturemodule.md) | Defines the feature module. The ID identifies the section in the state and is also used to globally discriminate features.<!-- -->After instantiating a feature store the store will fire an initialization action for that feature. Use [ofInitFeature()](./redux-store.ofinitfeature.md) to register for these initialization actions. |
|  [ReduxFeatureModuleId](./redux-store.reduxfeaturemoduleid.md) | Feature module identifier. This wrapper around an ID is useful, because it carries type information. |
|  [ReduxRootStore](./redux-store.reduxrootstore.md) | Implementation of a store that manages sub-state as features. Features are added to the store automatically, when required by the select method. |
|  [ReduxRootStoreDependencies](./redux-store.reduxrootstoredependencies.md) | Dependencies object available for epics |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [rxDispatch](./redux-store.rxdispatch.md) | Binds the dispatch method |
|  [rxSelect](./redux-store.rxselect.md) | Exposes a memoized selector function |
|  [selectFeature](./redux-store.selectfeature.md) | Returns a selector that selects the given feature |
|  [selectPayload](./redux-store.selectpayload.md) | Selects the payload from a [PayloadAction](./redux-store.payloadaction.md) instance |
|  [STORE\_ID](./redux-store.store_id.md) | Exposes the namespace of this store. This constant can e.g. be used to prefix actions. |
|  [VERSION](./redux-store.version.md) | Version and build number of the package |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [ReduxRootState](./redux-store.reduxrootstate.md) | Root state for the reducer, this is a mapping from feature ID to feature. |
