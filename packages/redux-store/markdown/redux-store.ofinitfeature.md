## ofInitFeature() function

Returns an operator function that filters the initialization actions for a particular feature. This is typically used in feature epics. Since we know that an initialization can occur at most once, the operator also terminates automatically after the first emission.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function ofInitFeature<A = AnyAction>(idOrModuleId: string | ReduxFeatureModuleId<any, any>): OperatorFunction<A, string>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  idOrModuleId | <code>string &#124; ReduxFeatureModuleId&lt;any, any&gt;</code> | the feature ID to filter for |

<b>Returns:</b>

`OperatorFunction<A, string>`

the operator function that filters for the initialization action and resolves to the ID of the feature
