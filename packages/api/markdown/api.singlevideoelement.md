## SingleVideoElement interface

Standard video element is similar to the file element. The video asset is represented in the asset section. Optionally a video asset can have a caption and a thumbnail as well, and in this case both of these point two resources in content hub. As mentioned with file, most of the properties here are inlined data from the asset/resource and is read-only. To update a video asset or its caption/thumbnail update the relevant asset/resource ID. The related information is retrieved again and added. Attempts to change the read-only fields are ignored.

```typescript
export interface SingleVideoElement extends VideoElement, Video 
```
