## SingleImageElement interface

Image is one of the more complex elements and the following section describes a normal image without an image profile configured. For information on updating and formatting the image element, go to Updating image element format.

Note: You are always selecting a rendition of an asset and not the asset directly. As a result interactions with image elements involve setting and updating a rendition reference. Most other fields that are displayed in image element are read only!

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface SingleImageElement extends ImageElement, Image 
```
