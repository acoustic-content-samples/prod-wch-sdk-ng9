## SingleFileElement interface

File element is the most basic asset reference element. It is a reference element that is used to point to an asset in content hub. Except for asset ID, all the other properties are read-only and are added from the asset at the time it is selected on a content.

With asset references most of the properties are read-only and come from the asset. So when you set a file on file element you need to set the asset.id property. The other information is fetched automatically by the content service and stored in read-only fields.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface SingleFileElement extends FileElement, File 
```
