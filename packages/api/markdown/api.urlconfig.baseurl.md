## UrlConfig.baseUrl property

The base URL of the host the application is running on. This can be undefined if the application is rendered standalone as part of the universal renderer. This prefix will be preserved when generating and recognizing URLs.

In many cases it is identical to the resourceUrl, but it will e.g. be different for applications that are not hosted on WCH.
