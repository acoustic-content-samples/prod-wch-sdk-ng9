## Category interface

Category is a reference element. The contents that are stored in the category element are references to categories created in content hub. When ?include=metadata is used, the categories property is included which has the full name path for each selected category.

Note: When you set categories on the category element, you need to add the UUID of the category to the categoryIds property. The categories property, which returns the name path of the category is a read-only property and is not used when the content is updated. If you set it during an update, it is ignored.

<b>Signature:</b>
