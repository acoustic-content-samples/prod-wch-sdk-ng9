## cacheLast() function

Operator that will replay the last value of a sequence to potentially many subscribers. The following assertions hold true:

- there will be no identical subsequent values - there will be at most one subscription to the original sequence - if there are no more subscriptions to the resulting observable (refcount falls to zero), the operator unsubscribes from the source - if the original sequence has produced at least one value, this value will be the starting

This operator differs from `shareReplay(1)` in the following way (in addition to ensuring a unique sequence): - if the source observable is hot, then `shareReplay(1)` will never unsubscribe even if its subscriptions fall to zero. `cacheLast` will unsubscribe - if the source observable is cold but still producing values when subscriptions fall to zero, then `shareReplay(1)` will not unsubscribe and will not cancel the sequence. `cacheLast` will unsubscribe and cancel the sequence.

This operator differs from `shareReplay({bufferSize: 1, refCount: true})` in the following way (in addition to ensuring a unique sequence): - if subscriptions fall to zero, then with `shareReplay` the first value that subsequent subscriptions will get is the first value of a new subscription to the source sequence. With `cacheLast` the first value will be the last value of the previous subscription.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function cacheLast<T>(aEqualFunction?: EqualsPredicate<T>, scheduler?: SchedulerLike): MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  aEqualFunction | <code>EqualsPredicate&lt;T&gt;</code> | compares the subsequent value |
|  scheduler | <code>SchedulerLike</code> | optional scheduler |

<b>Returns:</b>

`MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T>`

the cached operator
